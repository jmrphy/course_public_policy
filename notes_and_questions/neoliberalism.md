Week 2:

Main points:

Historically, the expansion of markets is always a political project. "Laissez-faire was planned," writes Polanyi, in the sense that the construction of a self-regulating market was a long and difficult political project which had to be created. Expansion of markets leads to spontaneous social backlashes. When landowners began to enclose common arable lands to private pastures in the 1400 and 1500s, there were massive riots such as Kett's Rebellion in 1549 and the Midland Revot of 1607 and the Newton Rebellion of 1607. This led to anti-enclosure movements and the Elizabethan Poor Laws beginning in the early 17th century. The beginning of the industrial revolution also so much discontent, and therefore required more innovations to the poor laws, such as the infamous Speenhamland system. This is the double movement.

Finally, at the end of World War II, there was "embedded liberalism," which Ruggie describes and theorizes in Polanyian terms.

Week 3:

Last week we discussed the relationship between markets and public policy in historical perspective. The Polanyi/Ruggie perspective is a critical one in the sense that it questions the historical development of capitalism but it was primarily empirical and historically uncontroversial.

This week is more explicitly critical.

What is "neoliberalism" and how does it contrast with embedded liberalism and the Keynesian "social pacts" which were the norm of the post-war period?

	- cut social spending
	- privatize
	- internationalize
	- deregulation

How was neoliberalism possible if the expansion of markets always historically required the double movement?

How does Klein's history of the Friedmanites support Polanyi's arguments?

What is the nature of public policymaking under neoliberalism?

Who has benefitted from neoliberal policies, and who has been harmed?

How does the history of the neoliberal policy project help explain the contemporary politics of policymaking, for instance policymaking before and after the 2008 financial crisis?
