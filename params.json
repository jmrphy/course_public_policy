It looks at emerging trends and ideas in the policy world about how to orient the policy process more towards the public, and critically examines the desirability and plausibility of many of these moves. The course will draw upon real-world examples to illuminate academic debates, encouraging students to make links between theory and practice.\r\n\r\nThe course aims to familiarise students with key arguments about inclusion and exclusion in public policymaking, and to give them the tools required to critically analyse them. The theoretical/conceptual material is complemented by empirical cases studies of real-world issues in public policy. Where appropriate, students will also be introduced to academic scholarship which sometimes challenges the intentions and expectations of bureaucrats, activists, policymakers, and mass publics. The case studies will make use of primary policy documents – such as government white papers, parliamentary papers, think tank reports etc. – which help contextualize the academic material, and expose students to ‘real world’ policy making.\r\n\r\n#### Course Structure\r\n\r\nThe module is delivered through a series of 12 two-hour seminars. Across the span of twelve 2-hour seminar sessions, a range of topics related to the overarching theme will be explored. The co-convenors will outline alternative viewpoints each week, encouraging students to engage deeply and critically with the material. This handbook outlines a series of theoretical questions for discussion in the seminar, as well as specific questions/tasks in relation to the case material. In preparation for each seminar, please attempt to read as many of the core readings as possible as well as looking at and/or helping to develop the case materials for each week, as these will form the basis of discussions. We have endeavoured to make sure that most are available electronically so they will be easily accessible. The additional readings are provided for each week if you wish to read further into a topic, such as in relation to the assessed essay or the case study.    \r\n\r\nThis handbook is your guide to the material covered on the course, but please check Blackboard regularly for new materials that have been added (readings and multimedia will be uploaded there) and announcements (which will also be sent via email).\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites and Restrictions\r\n\r\nThere are no prerequisites or restrictions.\r\n\r\n#### Summary of teaching and learning outcomes\r\n\r\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to:\r\n\r\n- understand and critique academic arguments about inclusion and exclusion in public policy processes.\r\n- link these academic arguments to real-world issues and events.\r\n- apply independent research skills both to relevant academic literatures and policy-oriented documents and evidence.\r\n- use oral communication skills for the purposes of presenting the findings of their research during seminars.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully completed the module, you will be able to demonstrate:\r\n- An understanding of the normative arguments for greater public inclusion in the policymaking process\r\n- An understanding of important trends in policymaking practice that are related to these arguments\r\n- A critical understanding of these emerging practices and their capacity to include and exclude\r\n- An awareness of the possibilities and limitations of making public policy more inclusive\r\n\r\n#### Academic Integrity\r\n\r\nThe University of Southampton takes cases of plagiarism very seriously. Plagiarism is representing the work of others as your own without proper acknowledgement of the original source. Plagiarism is not only dishonest but impedes your learning as it is indicative of a failure to understand the material. \r\n\r\nThe University of Southampton’s policy on plagiarism can be found here.  \r\n\r\nThe penalties for plagiarism range from resubmission of the piece of work to expulsion or exclusion from the University in very serious cases. If you have any doubts regarding how to reference or whether a source should be referenced speak to either of the module convenors immediately. It is always better to seek help than risk the penalties. \r\n\r\n#### Feedback to and from Students\r\n\r\n'Feedback' refers to any instance in which you receive information about how well you understand the material, how successfully you are progressing in the module, or how to improve your performance. Feedback is continuous and does not refer merely to comments on your assessed work (but certainly includes that). Other instances in which you receive feedback include: seminar discussions, question time during lectures, interaction with others outside the classroom, replies to email questions you send me, discussions with me during my office hours.\r\n\r\nModule evaluation forms will be distributed at the end of the semester. We welcome informal feedback at any time.\r\n\r\n#### Required Reading\r\n\r\nThere is no single book for purchase. Key readings are available online, so there should be no difficulty in preparing for each seminar. You will be expected to help develop the case materials for many of the seminars by identifying relevant policy documents, white papers, newspaper articles or multimedia clips in relation to the seminar content. The rationale behind this is that you will need to engage in greater depth with the themes and ideas in the module, and that you will also develop your analytical and research skills. An important additional benefit is that this material will prove very useful in developing your work for assessment. \r\n\r\nThe reading for each week is organised with a series of ‘core’ readings, which you should attempt to read a selection of, to build on the material covered in the lecture, and ‘further’ readings that allow you to explore the topics that interest you further. These are provided to give you choice in your reading. Please prepare for the seminars by reading the ‘case materials’ and by searching for and identifying additional material from sources such as policy documents, white papers and newspaper articles.\r\n\r\nWhere possible we have sought to include hyperlinks to e-books, journal articles and other publications to ensure that these are easily available, and so that that you can dedicate your time to reading them rather than searching for them. A small number of the books are not available in an electronic format. If any of the hyperlinks are broken, please let me know immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Assessment\r\n\r\nThe mode of assessment for the module is as follows:\r\n\r\n- An assessed essay with a maximum length of 4,000 words. \r\n- An analysis of a case study, chosen by you, with a maximum length of 3,000 words.\r\n- A presentation of the key findings of your case study. The presentation should last no more than 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe essay will make up 40% of the final grade. The case study will account for 40% and the presentation is worth 20% of the final grade. \r\n\r\n**Deadlines**\r\n\r\nSubmit an electronic copy of your essay via Turnitin to the Blackboard site on Monday 12th March 2013. \r\n\r\nThe subject and title of your case study must be agreed with one or both of the co-conveners by 3.00pm on Friday 16th March 2013. This can be done via email correspondence or via appointment. You will give a presentation about your case study during the seminar on 17th May 2013.\r\n\r\nThe completed case study must be submitted via Turnitin to the Blackboard site on Monday 4th June 2013.\r\n\r\nExtensions can only be arranged by meeting with the MSc Coordinator (Dr Pia Riggirozzi) in advance. Coursework submitted late without an agreed extension will face the appropriate penalty as outlined in the Postgraduate Handbook.\r\n\r\n**Style Guidelines**\r\n\r\nAll coursework must be typed or word processed, 1.5 line-spaced, contain a bibliography, and use the Harvard style of referencing.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nThe seminars, other than the introductory week and the sessions devoted to student presentations, will be led by one of the two lecturers on an alternating basis, engendering distinct orientations to the various themes. This approach will enable deep and critical engagement in the themes under discussion. The programme is as follows.\r\n\r\n##### Week 1.
